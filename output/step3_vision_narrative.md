## Vision Narrative

Sarah, a payroll admin at a 75-person tech startup in Austin, opens her laptop at 8:47 AM with her coffee still steaming. The dashboard shows all 75 employees' payroll processed flawlessly overnight—Texas state taxes filed, 401(k) contributions synced, new engineer from California onboarded automatically. She remembers three years ago when switching payroll providers meant weeks of manual data entry and compliance anxiety. Now? Their CEO signed up last Tuesday, imported all employee data in 12 minutes, and ran their first payroll that Friday. 

The AI compliance engine had already configured multi-state tax withholdings for their remote team across CA, NY, and IL. When their Series B funding hit, scaling from 30 to 75 employees took zero additional payroll overhead. Sarah spends her mornings on strategic HR initiatives now—designing career frameworks, not debugging tax calculations. Their engineering team ships features 3x faster since ditching their previous provider's API limitations. Even their investors noticed: "How did you onboard 45 people in Q3 without adding HR headcount?" 

Sarah smiles, clicks approve on the pre-staged Q4 bonus run, and heads to the product roadmap meeting. Payroll just works.

## North-Star Metric

**Time-to-First-Successful-Payroll: ≤ 48 hours**

This metric captures our entire value proposition: trust through speed. When SMBs can go from signup to successful payroll run in under 2 days—with full compliance automation—we've eliminated the friction that keeps them locked into legacy providers. This single metric forces us to nail onboarding, automation, and reliability simultaneously.

## Supporting Metrics

1. **Multi-State Compliance Coverage: 15+ states automated** - Expanding from 0 to 15+ states unlocks 95% of the U.S. SMB market, removing the geographic constraints that limit customer acquisition.

2. **Customer Payroll Processing Time: <5 minutes/run** - Reducing admin time from hours to minutes creates the operational leverage that lets growing companies scale without adding HR overhead.

3. **API Uptime & Performance: 99.99% availability, <100ms response** - Developer-grade infrastructure becomes our competitive moat, enabling the third-party integrations and automation that Gusto can't match.
