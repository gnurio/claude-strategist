# Backlog Prioritization Results

## Scoring Method
Impact scores (1-5) reflect how directly each item advances its pillar's target metric, with 5 being transformative and 1 being incremental. Effort scores (1-5) consider technical complexity and time investment for our 5-engineer team, where 5 represents multi-sprint epics and 1 represents quick wins. Priority Score = Impact - Effort guides sequencing.
