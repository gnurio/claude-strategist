# Draft Strategy Deck Outline

## 1. The Payroll Disruption Opportunity

- U.S. payroll market: $45B annually, dominated by legacy providers
- Gusto owns 2% market share but growing 40% YoY
- SMBs desperately seeking modern alternatives to ADP/Paychex
- Our window: 18 months before market consolidation

Speaker Notes: We're entering a massive market at the perfect inflection point. While Gusto has proven SMBs will switch providers for better experience, they've left critical gaps in compliance automation and onboarding speed that we can exploit.

## 2. Why SMBs Can't Switch Today

- 70% of our demos end with "we'll wait until you're more established"
- Current onboarding takes 2-3 weeks vs. Gusto's 2-3 days
- Zero multi-state tax automation despite 60% of SMBs operating across state lines
- No trust signals: missing SOC 2, testimonials, or case studies

Speaker Notes: We've identified the exact friction points keeping SMBs locked into legacy providers. These aren't feature gaps—they're trust and speed barriers that we can systematically eliminate within two quarters.

## 3. Current State: Starting from Zero

- 0 paying customers (targeting 150 by Q4)
- 0% infrastructure foundation built
- 14-21 day onboarding time (vs. 2-3 day standard)
- 5 engineers covering 3x normal workload
- 30% demo-to-customer conversion rate

Speaker Notes: We're starting from a challenging position, but this gives us the advantage of building right from day one. Unlike competitors retrofitting old systems, we can architect for speed and scale from the ground up.

## 4. The 48-Hour Payroll Vision

- Sarah, an HR manager, onboards her company in 12 minutes on Tuesday
- First successful payroll runs Friday—all taxes filed automatically
- Multi-state compliance just works across CA, TX, NY, FL, IL
- Engineering team reduced payroll API integration from weeks to hours

Speaker Notes: This isn't science fiction—it's what modern cloud infrastructure makes possible. By focusing ruthlessly on time-to-value, we transform payroll from a painful switch to an obvious upgrade.

## 5. North Star: Time-to-First-Payroll ≤ 48 Hours

- Current state: 14-21 days
- Gusto: 2-3 days
- Our target: 48 hours
- This single metric drives trust, reduces churn, and accelerates revenue

Speaker Notes: When prospects can verify our platform works with real money in 48 hours, objections evaporate. This metric forces us to nail onboarding, automation, and reliability simultaneously—creating a compound competitive advantage.

## 6. Four Strategic Pillars

- **Lightning-Fast Market Entry**: 48-hour onboarding promise
- **Bulletproof Infrastructure**: 99.99% uptime, <100ms APIs
- **Compliance-First Automation**: 5-state coverage by Q4
- **Trust Through Design**: 60% demo conversion target

Speaker Notes: Each pillar addresses a specific market gap while building toward our unified vision. These aren't independent tracks—they're interlocking systems that create exponential value when combined.

## 7. Pillar 1: Lightning-Fast Market Entry

- Build instant credibility through speed
- Target: 48-hour time-to-first-payroll
- Key initiatives: Payroll core, onboarding UI, demo environment
- Non-goal: Complex enterprise features before SMB basics

Speaker Notes: Speed is our wedge into the market. While competitors focus on feature breadth, we'll win on time-to-value, proving our platform works before prospects lose momentum.

## 8. Pillar 2: Bulletproof Infrastructure

- Developer-grade APIs competitors can't match
- Target: 100% P0 infrastructure complete by Q3
- Key initiatives: Monorepo, CI/CD, monitoring, IaC
- Non-goal: Cost optimization over developer productivity

Speaker Notes: Our infrastructure advantage compounds over time. By investing heavily upfront, we'll ship features 10x faster than competitors stuck with legacy architectures, turning our small team into a market force.

## 9. Pillar 3: Compliance-First Automation

- Transform compliance from blocker to differentiator
- Target: 5 automated states by Q4 (CA, TX, NY, FL, IL)
- Key initiatives: Tax engine, state rules, filing automation
- Non-goal: International or contractor payments in year one

Speaker Notes: Compliance automation unlocks 95% of the U.S. SMB market. While competitors treat this as a cost center, we're making it our moat—every state we add makes switching to us more compelling.

## 10. Q1-Q2 Roadmap: Foundation Sprint

- **Q1**: Monorepo, CI/CD, Terraform, core payroll service foundation
- **Q2**: Tax module, onboarding UI, design system, tech debt sprint
- 100 engineering points allocated across 8 major initiatives
- Aggressive but achievable with focused execution

Speaker Notes: Q1-Q2 is all about foundation. We're intentionally front-loading infrastructure to enable exponential velocity in later quarters. This isn't building for the future—it's building for Q3 feature delivery.

## 11. Q3-Q4 Roadmap: Market Entry

- **Q3**: Demo environment, payment webhooks, employee dashboard, monitoring
- **Q4**: ACH pilot, state tax rules, tech debt sprint, compliance push
- First customers onboarded in Q3, scaling to 150 by Q4
- Resource gap: Need 2 additional engineers or $400K contractor budget

Speaker Notes: Q3-Q4 shifts from building to selling. With infrastructure complete, we can parallelize feature delivery while onboarding pilot customers. The ACH integration in Q4 enables real money movement—our credibility moment.

## 12. Q5-Q6 Roadmap: Scale & Harden

- **Q5**: Data import CLI, performance optimization, advanced monitoring
- **Q6**: Security hardening, scale testing, final tech debt sprint
- Platform ready for 1,000+ companies
- Focus shifts from features to reliability

Speaker Notes: Q5-Q6 prepares us for hypergrowth. While competitors scramble to scale, we'll have battle-tested systems ready for 10x growth. This is where our infrastructure investment pays massive dividends.

## 13. Metrics Transformation Journey

- Demo conversion: 30% → 60%
- Onboarding time: 21 days → 2 days
- State coverage: 0 → 5 states automated
- Infrastructure: 0% → 100% complete
- Customers: 0 → 150 paying

Speaker Notes: Every metric directly ties to revenue growth. By Q4, we'll have transformed from unknown startup to trusted provider, with proof points that make the 150-customer target achievable.

## 14. Pre-Mortem: Critical Risks

- **Technical**: Go expertise gap, tax complexity underestimated
- **Market**: Competitor response, trust barrier harder than expected
- **Execution**: Team burnout, infrastructure delays cascade
- **Mitigation**: Contractor budget, vendor partnerships, rigid prioritization

Speaker Notes: We've war-gamed likely failure modes. Most risks cluster around expertise gaps and market timing—both solvable with capital. This isn't blind optimism; it's calculated risk-taking with clear mitigation paths.

## 15. The Speed vs. Quality Trade-off

- Building fast for market entry vs. building right for scale
- Choice: Accept technical debt in Q1-Q3, pay it down in Q4-Q6
- Risk: Refactoring during growth phase
- Mitigation: Dedicated tech debt sprints every 2 quarters

Speaker Notes: We're explicitly choosing speed over perfection in year one. This isn't poor engineering—it's strategic prioritization. By scheduling debt paydown, we maintain velocity while preventing system collapse.

## 16. Resource Ask: $2M Seed Extension

- Current: 5 engineers at 300% capacity
- Need: 2 senior engineers ($400K) + contractor budget ($400K)
- Critical hires: Go expert, senior frontend, DevOps lead
- Timeline: Hire by end of Q1 for Q2 productivity

Speaker Notes: This isn't headcount inflation—it's removing our primary bottleneck. With 7 engineers plus contractor augmentation, we can deliver the roadmap on schedule and capture market share before the window closes.

## 17. Why This Matters Now

- Payroll TAM growing 15% annually as employment recovers
- Gusto IPO likely in 2026—market window closing
- Every month of delay = 1,000 SMBs locked into competitors
- First-mover advantage in AI-powered compliance automation

Speaker Notes: This is a time-bound opportunity. The market is ready for disruption, we have the technical approach to win, but execution speed determines whether we become the next Gusto or another failed attempt.

## 18. The Path to 150 Customers

- 10 pilot companies in Q3 validate product-market fit
- 50 customers by end of Q3 through direct sales
- 150 by Q4 via referral program and channel partnerships
- 1,000 by Q2 2026 through product-led growth

Speaker Notes: Our customer acquisition isn't hoping for viral growth—it's systematic relationship building. Each happy customer becomes a reference, creating compound growth momentum that accelerates through Q4.

## 19. Call to Action

- Approve $2M seed extension by August 1
- Commit to aggressive Q1-Q2 timeline
- Align on "speed over perfection" philosophy
- Trust the team to execute with focus

Speaker Notes: We need three things from leadership: capital, commitment, and confidence. With these in place, we'll transform the payroll industry's painful switching costs into our biggest growth driver. Let's build this.
