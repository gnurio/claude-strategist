3. **Engineering Bandwidth (300% overutilized)** - Team of 5 engineers facing 3x normal workload, creating severe delivery risk

4. **Customer Acquisition (0 paying customers)** - Starting from zero with aggressive Q4 target of 150 customers requires immediate traction

5. **Onboarding Time (14-21 days vs. 2-3 days competitor)** - 7-10x slower than Gusto, causing 50%+ prospect abandonment
