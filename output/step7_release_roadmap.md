## Resource Ask:

Based on current capacity assumptions of 5 engineers delivering approximately 50 points per quarter, this roadmap requires 370 total points across 6 quarters (300 points available). The 70-point shortfall represents 1.4 quarters of additional work. To deliver all initiatives on schedule, we need either 2 additional senior engineers starting Q2 or $400K in contractor budget to augment critical path items. Without this investment, the roadmap will extend into Q7-Q8, delaying our market entry and risking competitive disadvantage against Gusto's established presence.
