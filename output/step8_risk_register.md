## Trade-off Summary

The biggest trade-off is between moving fast to capture market share versus building a robust, scalable platform from the start. The aggressive timeline to reach 150 customers by Q4 forces infrastructure shortcuts in Q1-Q2 that will likely require significant refactoring in Q5-Q6, potentially limiting our ability to scale just as growth accelerates. This "build twice" approach risks both technical debt accumulation and team burnout, but may be necessary to establish market presence before competitors lock in SMB customers.
