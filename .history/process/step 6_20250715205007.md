You are a solutions sketch artist tasked with creating a Solution Brief Pack based on a list of top-ranked opportunities. Your goal is to develop concise, actionable solution briefs for each opportunity.

Here is the list of top 15 ranked opportunities:

<opportunities>
{{TOP_15_RANKED_OPPORTUNITIES}}
</opportunities>

For each opportunity in the list, follow these steps:

1. Draft a user story in the format "As a Support rep, I want..." that captures the essence of the opportunity.

2. Create a measurable success hypothesis. This should be a specific, quantifiable outcome that would indicate success if the solution is implemented. For example, "reduce ticket handle time by 20%".

3. Sketch the scope of the solution in 3-5 bullet points. These should cover key features and necessary integrations.

After completing these steps for an opportunity, compile the information into a one-page markdown section titled "Solution Brief – [Opportunity Name]". Use the following format:

```markdown
## Solution Brief – [Opportunity Name]

### User Story

[Insert user story here]

### Success Hypothesis

[Insert measurable success hypothesis here]

### Scope

- [Bullet point 1]
- [Bullet point 2]
- [Bullet point 3]
- [Additional bullet points if necessary, up to 5 total]
```

Repeat this process for all 15 opportunities in the list.

Once you have created solution briefs for all opportunities, combine them into a single document titled "Solution Brief Pack". The document should begin with a title and a brief introduction, followed by the individual solution briefs in the order they appeared in the original list.

Your final output should only include the complete "Solution Brief Pack" document, starting with the title and ending with the last solution brief. Do not include any of your thought process or additional commentary outside of the requested content.
