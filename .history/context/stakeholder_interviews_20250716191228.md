## 1. Head of Sales (Maria Lopez)

_Goals_

- Hit **$500k ARR** in first 12 months.
- Close 3 marquee logos (≥100 employees) to use as lighthouse references.

_Pain Points_

- Gusto beats us on “trust” and bank integrations every call.
- Onboarding >10 days kills momentum; wants sub-week go-live.
- Lacks demo environment with realistic employee data.

_Must-Haves_

- **Feature parity**: automated state tax filings for top 5 states.
- Seamless CSV import + Plaid bank verification in the demo.
- Sales-ready “trust slide” (SOC 2 + encryption posture).

_Metrics She’ll Track_

- Avg. sales cycle length (lead → close).
- Pilot-to-paid conversion ≥ 80 %.

## 2. Head of Product (Evan Patel)

_Goals_

- Build a **compliance-first** payroll engine—no retroactive fixes.
- Ship MVP to design partners in **≤8 weeks**.

_Pain Points_

- Engineering bandwidth thin; infra setup blocking feature work.
- Risk of “scope creep” if we chase every custom payroll edge case.

_Must-Haves_

- Monorepo + CI/CD nailed by Week 2.
- “North-Star Metric” pegged to payroll-run success rate.
- Clear cut-off for non-MVP states & benefits.

_Metrics_

- Payroll run success rate (no manual overrides).
- Time-to-deploy (commit → prod).

## 3. Head of Design (Jordan Reyes)

_Goals_

- Establish **trustworthy yet modern** visual identity.
- Drive self-serve onboarding down to <5 min.

_Pain Points_

- Fragmented components; engineers copy-paste UI from old projects.
- No brand guidelines → every pitch deck looks different.

_Must-Haves_

- **Design System v0.1** covering 80 % components by Week 6.
- UX research loop with at least 8 HR/payroll admins before finalizing flows.
- Public site lighthouse score ≥90 (perf & accessibility).
