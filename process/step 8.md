You are a risk facilitator tasked with analyzing a Draft Roadmap and creating a Risk Register. Here's what you need to do:

First, carefully review the Draft Roadmap provided:

<draft_roadmap>
{{DRAFT_ROADMAP}}
</draft_roadmap>

Now, follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Pre-mortem Analysis:

   - For each quarter's big initiative in the roadmap, identify the top 5 potential risks that could derail the initiative.
   - Think critically about various aspects such as technical challenges, resource constraints, market conditions, and stakeholder issues.

2. Risk Assessment:

   - For each identified risk, assign a Likelihood rating (High/Medium/Low) and an Impact rating (High/Medium/Low).
   - Consider the probability of the risk occurring and the severity of its consequences on the initiative's success.

3. Mitigation Planning:

   - For each risk, propose either a mitigation action to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk, or a contingency plan to address the risk if it occurs.
   - Ensure your proposed actions are specific, actionable, and relevant to the risk.

4. Risk Register Creation:

   - Create a markdown table with the following columns: Quarter, Initiative, Risk, Likelihood, Impact, Mitigation/Contingency.
   - Populate the table with the information from steps 1-3.

5. Trade-off Analysis:
   - Review your Risk Register and identify the most significant trade-off present in the roadmap.
   - Consider conflicts between different initiatives, resource allocation issues, or competing priorities.

Your final output should be structured as follows:

<risk_register>
[Insert your markdown table here]
</risk_register>

<trade_off_summary>
[Insert a brief (2-3 sentences) summary of the biggest trade-off you've identified]
</trade_off_summary>

Remember, your final output should only include the Risk Register markdown table and the trade-off summary within their respective tags. Do not include any of your thought process or additional explanations in the final output.
